# 🧠 Spiking Neural Network Decoder

This project simulates neuron spike activity using the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** model and decodes rat decision-making behaviors using machine learning.


## 📌 Objectives

- Simulate biologically realistic spikes with the LIF model.
- Estimate firing rates from spike trains.
- Classify rat behavior using firing rate patterns and ML models.


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (SVM, LDA, Random Forest, AdaBoost)


## 📊 Sample Output

- Spike simulation vs. real spike comparison
- Correlation analysis
- Firing rate plots
- Classifier accuracy & confusion matrix

## 💡 Why This Project?

As someone deeply interested in cognitive modeling and bio-inspired AI, I wanted to explore how real neural activity relates to decision-making. This project bridges neuroscience and machine learning and gave me insights into how sparse spike data can be decoded to understand behavior.
